# Mini-COVIDNet
Deep Neural Network for Ultrasound based Point-of-Care Testing of COVID-19

Mobile network based models are proposed for making smalle models for COVID-19 detection and 
compared with state of the art techniques for ultrasound imaging. We compared our models with other state
of the aret techniques such as POCOVID-Net and comapred our models in terms of size, number of parameters as well as the 
various figures of merit.


This repository conatins the notebooks for all the codes which were run for all the models proposed and compared.

The various models comapred here can be given as:

* COVID-CAPS
* COVID-Net
* Mini-COVIDNet
* Mini-COVIDNet (focal loss)
* MOBILENetV2
* NASNETMOBILE
